OUTPUT:
Let’s analyze the **NewContent** “Return to starting position” in the context of the **CurGraph** given.  

---

**Step 1 – Understanding the current geometric structure**  

From **CurGraph**:  

**Elements**:  
1. `Point(0.00, 0.00)` – center  
2. `Circle(radius=50.00)` – presumably centered at Point1  
3. `Point(50.00, 0.00)` – moving point  

**Relations**:  
1. `on_circle` – Point3 is on Circle2  
2. `distance constraint` – distance from Point1 to Point3 = 50.00  

This means:  
- Point1 is the center of the circle.  
- Point3 lies on the circle at coordinates (50, 0), which is the starting position (rightmost point on the circle).  

---

**Step 2 – Interpreting “Return to starting position”**  

The phrase suggests that Point3 might have moved away from (50, 0) at some earlier stage, and now we are resetting it to its initial location.  
But in the **CurGraph**, Point3 is already at (50, 0).  

So “Return to starting position” is a **command** that imposes a **new relation** or **constraint** between Point3 and its original location.  

Since the starting position is defined as (50, 0) relative to center (0, 0), this is equivalent to saying:  
- Point3 must satisfy `Point3.x = 50.00` and `Point3.y = 0.00`.  
- But in geometry constraints, we can model this as:  
  1. Point3 lies on the horizontal line through center (y=0).  
  2. Point3 is at distance 50 from center.  
  3. Point3 is to the right of center (x > 0).  

However, in the current graph, we already have `distance = 50` and `on_circle`.  
To fix it to (50, 0) uniquely, we need an additional constraint: `Point3 lies on the horizontal ray from center to the right`.  

But in simple geometric constraint systems, “return to starting position” might be implemented as:  
- A **coincidence constraint** between Point3 and a new point representing the starting position.  
But here, the starting position isn’t stored as a separate point yet.  

So the **geometric modeling** of this command is:  
We create a new element: `Point(50.00, 0.00) - start_position` (but note: that’s exactly Point3’s current coordinates, so maybe it’s the same point? No — we need to distinguish between the moving point and the fixed starting location).  

Actually, in constraint-based geometry, we would:  
1. Create a new point `StartPoint` at (50, 0).  
2. Add a `coincident` constraint between Point3 and StartPoint.  

---

**Step 3 – Constructing the NewGraph**  

We keep all existing elements.  
We add a new element: `Point(50.00, 0.00) - start_position` (but careful: this has same coords as Point3 originally, but now it’s a separate fixed point).  

But in the given CurGraph, Point3 is named `Point(50.00, 0.00) - moving`. So maybe the starting position is not stored as a separate point yet.  
Thus “Return to starting position” means:  
Add a new point `StartPosition` with coordinates (50,0), and add a constraint that Point3 coincides with it.  

But if we do that, we must also relate StartPosition to the circle: it lies on the circle.  

---

**Step 4 – Writing final answer in the required format**  

We start from CurGraph and add:  

**New elements**:  
- `Point(50.00, 0.00) - start_position` (fixed reference point)  

**New relations**:  
- `coincident` between Point3 and StartPosition  
- `on_circle` between StartPosition and Circle2 (since it’s on the circle)  

But note: The distance constraint between Point1 and Point3 is already there, and if Point3 coincides with StartPosition, then StartPosition automatically satisfies distance=50 from Point1.  

---

**Final Answer**:

**Geometry Elements List**:  
1. Point(0.00, 0.00) - center  
2. Circle(radius=50.00)  
3. Point(50.00, 0.00) - moving  
4. Point(50.00, 0.00) - start_position  

**Geometry Relations List**:  
1. on_circle – point3 on_circle2  
2. distance constraint – point1 to point3 distance=50.00  
3. on_circle – start_position on_circle2  
4. coincident – moving coincident start_position  

---

**Note**: Relation 3 ensures start_position is on the circle (implied by its coordinates and circle’s center at (0,0), radius 50), and relation 4 forces the moving point back to the start position.
