OUTPUT:
**Analysis of the New Content**

The instruction "Continue rotating to 90 degree position" is an action applied to the existing geometric structure. It modifies the state of a dynamic element (the moving point) but does not introduce new fundamental geometric elements (like new shapes or fixed points) or new types of relationships (like tangency or parallelism).

In the current graph, `Point(50.00, 0.00)` is defined as a "moving" point constrained to lie on the circle centered at `Point(0.00, 0.00)`. The action rotates this point from its current position (0°) to a new position at 90°.

**Result of the Construction**

The action updates the coordinates of the existing moving point. The core geometric structure—the circle, its center, and the on-circle relationship—remains unchanged. Therefore, the final graph description lists the same elements and relations, with the understanding that the state of `Point(50.00, 0.00)` has been updated to `(0.00, 50.00)`.

**NewGraph**

Geometry Elements List:
1. Point_Center
2. Circle_Main
3. Point_Moving

Geometry Relations List:
1. on_circle
   - Start: Point_Moving
   - Target: Circle_Main
2. distance_constraint
   - Start: Point_Center
   - Target: Point_Moving

*(Note: The `Point_Moving` now has coordinates (0.00, 50.00) as a result of the rotation action.)*
