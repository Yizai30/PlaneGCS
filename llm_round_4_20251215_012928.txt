OUTPUT:
Let’s analyze the current geometry graph and the new content step by step.  

---

**Current geometry graph structure**  
From the given:  

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. Point(0.00, 0.00) — center (let’s call it `Point_Center`)  
2. Circle(radius=50.00) — let’s call it `Circle_A`  
3. Point(50.00, 0.00) — moving (let’s call it `Point_Moving`)  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. `on_circle` — `Point_Moving` on `Circle_A`  
2. `distance_constraint` — `Point_Center` to `Point_Moving` distance = 50.00  

---

**New content analysis**  
**NewContent:** “Rotate to 180 degree position”  

This means we are taking `Point_Moving` (currently at (50, 0)) and rotating it around `Point_Center` by 180°.  

After rotation:  
- `Point_Moving` will move to (−50, 0)  
- It will still be on `Circle_A`  
- Distance from `Point_Center` to `Point_Moving` remains 50  

No new geometric elements are created — only the coordinates of `Point_Moving` change.  
Relations remain the same.  

---

**Result in the requested format**  

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. Point_Center  
2. Circle_A  
3. Point_Moving  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point_Moving  
   - Target: Circle_A  
2. distance_constraint  
   - Start: Point_Center  
   - Target: Point_Moving
