OUTPUT:
**NewContent Analysis:**  
The instruction “Scale down to original size” implies that the current geometry graph (with a circle of radius 50 and a point at (50,0) on it) should be transformed so that the circle’s radius becomes 1, and the point on the circle moves accordingly to maintain the same relative position.

**Result of the construction of the geometric structure:**

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point (center)  
2. Circle (radius = 1.00)  
3. Point (1.00, 0.00) — moving point  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point (1.00, 0.00)  
   - Target: Circle (radius = 1.00)  
2. distance constraint  
   - Start: Point (center)  
   - Target: Point (1.00, 0.00)  
   - Distance = 1.00
