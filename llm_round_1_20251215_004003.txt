OUTPUT:
Let?s break down the given information step by step.  

---

**Current Graph (CurGraph) from the problem statement**  
Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point (center)  
2. Circle  
3. Point (moving)  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. `on_circle` ? point3 on_circle circle2  
2. `distance` ? point1 to point3 = 50.00  

---

**NewContent given**:  
> ??3??1??30?  

This means:  
- Point3 is rotated around Point1 by 30 degrees.  
- Since Point3 is on the circle centered at Point1 with radius 50, rotating it around the center keeps it on the same circle.  

---

**Resulting NewGraph**  
The elements remain the same:  
- Point1 (center)  
- Circle2 (center at Point1, radius 50)  
- Point3 (new position after rotation)  

Relations:  
1. `on_circle` ? Point3 on_circle Circle2 (still true after rotation)  
2. `distance` ? Point1 to Point3 = 50.00 (unchanged)  
3. **New relation**: `rotation` ? Point3 is rotated around Point1 by 30? relative to its original position.  

---

**Final answer in the required format**:

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point1  
2. Circle2  
3. Point3  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point3  
   - Target: Circle2  
2. distance  
   - Start: Point1  
   - Target: Point3  
3. rotation  
   - Start: Point3  
   - Target: Point1
