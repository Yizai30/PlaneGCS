OUTPUT:
Let’s analyze the **CurGraph** first.  

**Current Geometry Elements List:**
1. Point (Element1)  
2. Circle (Element2)  
3. Point (Element3)  

**Current Geometry Relations List:**
1. `on_circle`  
   - Start: Element3  
   - End: Element2  
2. `distance_constraint`  
   - Start: Element1  
   - End: Element3  

---

**Interpretation of the current situation:**  
- Element3 is a point on the circle (Element2).  
- Element1 is another point, and there is a fixed distance between Element1 and Element3.  
- This means Element3 moves along the circle, but its distance to Element1 is fixed.  
- That implies Element3 is at an intersection of the circle (Element2) and another circle centered at Element1 with radius equal to that fixed distance.  

---

**NewContent says:** *Return to starting position*  
This likely means:  
- Element3 was initially at a certain position relative to Element1 and Element2 (maybe the configuration where the two circles are tangent, or a specific intersection point).  
- “Return to starting position” could mean:  
  - Element3 is moved back to a specific location on the circle relative to Element1.  
  - Possibly the “starting position” is when Element3 is closest to Element1, or farthest, or along a certain line.  

But since we are only modeling the **geometric structure** after this instruction, we must deduce what new elements/relations appear.  

If “Return to starting position” is a constraint, it might mean:  
- Element3 is constrained to be at a particular point on the circle (maybe the point such that line Element1–Element3 passes through the center of the circle, or is tangent to something).  
- But in the current graph, we don’t have the circle’s center defined as an element.  

So maybe the system adds:  
- The center of the circle as a new point (Element4).  
- A relation that Element3 lies on line(Element1, Element4) or something similar.  

But the simplest interpretation: “starting position” means Element3 is at a point on the circle such that the distance constraint is satisfied **and** Element3 is collinear with Element1 and the circle’s center.  

---

**Thus, new elements:**  
- Center of circle (Element4)  
- Line through Element1 and Element4 (Element5)  

**New relations:**  
- Element4 is center_of Element2  
- Element3 lies on Element5  

---

**NewGraph** (after adding these):

**Geometry Elements List:**
1. Point (Element1)  
2. Circle (Element2)  
3. Point (Element3)  
4. Point (Element4) — center of circle  
5. Line (Element5) — line through Element1 and Element4  

**Geometry Relations List:**
1. `on_circle`  
   - Start: Element3  
   - End: Element2  
2. `distance_constraint`  
   - Start: Element1  
   - End: Element3  
3. `is_center_of`  
   - Start: Element4  
   - End: Element2  
4. `lies_on_line`  
   - Start: Element3  
   - End: Element5  
5. `lies_on_line`  
   - Start: Element1  
   - End: Element5  
6. `lies_on_line`  
   - Start: Element4  
   - End: Element5

**Final answer:**

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point  
2. Circle  
3. Point  
4. Point  
5. Line  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle
