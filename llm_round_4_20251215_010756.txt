OUTPUT:
Let?s analyze the given **NewContent** in the context of the **CurGraph**.  

**CurGraph** currently has:  
- Geometry Elements:  
  1. Point (0,0) ? center  
  2. Circle (radius 50)  
  3. Point (50,0) ? moving  
- Geometry Relations:  
  1. on_circle ? point3 on_circle2  
  2. distance constraint ? point1 to point3 distance = 50  

**NewContent** says:  
> ??????180??????  

This appears to be incomplete or corrupted text, but the number **180** suggests an angle measure (180 degrees).  
Given the existing structure:  
- We have a circle centered at (0,0) with radius 50.  
- We have a point (50,0) on the circle.  
- If we add a **180?** constraint, it likely means rotating the moving point around the center by 180?, which would place it at (?50,0) ? another point on the circle diametrically opposite.  

So the new content likely means:  
- Add a new point diametrically opposite to point3 across the center.  
- Or, it could mean adding a **180? angle** at the center between point3 and a new point.  

Since the text is unclear, I?ll interpret it as:  
**Add a new point such that the angle at the center between point3 and the new point is 180?** ? which means they are endpoints of a diameter.

**NewGraph** after adding this:  

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point (0,0) ? center  
2. Circle (radius=50)  
3. Point (50,0) ? moving  
4. Point (?50,0) ? new point  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle ? point3 on_circle2  
2. distance constraint ? point1 to point3 distance=50  
3. on_circle ? point4 on_circle2  
4. distance constraint ? point1 to point4 distance=50  
5. angle constraint ? angle(point3, point1, point4) = 180?  

---

**Final answer in requested format:**  

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point_center  
2. Circle_main  
3. Point_A  
4. Point_B  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Circle_main  
2. distance_constraint  
   - Start: Point_center  
   - Target: Point_A  
3. on_circle  
   - Start: Point_B  
   - Target: Circle_main  
4. distance_constraint  
   - Start: Point_center  
   - Target: Point_B  
5. angle_constraint  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Point_B  
   (Note: angle center is Point_center, value 180?)
