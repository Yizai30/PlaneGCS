OUTPUT:
Let?s break down the **NewContent** and the **CurGraph** step by step.  

---

**CurGraph** currently has:  

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. Point(0.00, 0.00) ? center  
2. Circle(radius=50.00)  
3. Point(50.00, 0.00) ? moving  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. on_circle ? point3 on_circle2  
2. distance constraint ? point1 to point3 distance=50.00  

---

**NewContent** given:  
`????????????????30??`  

This appears to be garbled or incomplete, but the `30` suggests a possible **angle** or **distance** constraint.  
Given the context of a circle with center at (0,0), radius 50, and a point (50,0) on it, a common next step in geometry problems is to add a **new point** with a **distance or angle constraint** relative to existing points.  

For example:  
- Maybe `30` means a point at 30? from the x-axis on the circle.  
- Or maybe `30` means a distance of 30 from something.  

Since the only other point besides center and (50,0) is not yet defined, a plausible interpretation is:  
**Add a new point on the circle, such that the arc length or central angle from point3 to this new point is 30?.**  

But in basic geometry constructions, `30` could also mean a **distance of 30 from the center** ? but that would be inside the circle (radius 50), so it could be a point on a smaller circle.  

Given the garbled text, I?ll assume the intended meaning is:  
**Add a new point at a distance of 30 from the center** ? which would be on a concentric circle of radius 30.  

---

### Updated structure:

**New element:**  
4. Point ? placed somewhere at distance 30 from center (0,0).  

**New relations:**  
1. distance constraint ? point1 to point4 distance=30.00  

---

**NewGraph** (after adding this):

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. Point(0.00, 0.00) ? center  
2. Circle(radius=50.00)  
3. Point(50.00, 0.00) ? moving  
4. Point ? new point  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. on_circle ? point3 on_circle2  
2. distance constraint ? point1 to point3 distance=50.00  
3. distance constraint ? point1 to point4 distance=30.00  

---

**Final answer in requested format:**

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point  
2. Circle  
3. Point  
4. Point  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point3  
   - Target: Circle2  
2. distance_constraint

   - Target: Point3  
3. distance_constraint  
   - Start: Point1  
   - Target: Point4
