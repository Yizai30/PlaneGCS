OUTPUT:
**Analysis of the New Content**  

The current geometry graph has:  
- A **center** point at (0, 0)  
- A **circle** with radius 50  
- A **moving** point initially at (50, 0) on the circle  

The new instruction is: *Move the point clockwise by 30 degrees*.  

This means:  
1. The moving point’s position changes, but it remains on the same circle.  
2. The center point and circle remain unchanged.  
3. The new coordinates can be calculated using rotation:  
   From (50, 0), clockwise 30° → (50·cos(-30°), 50·sin(-30°)) = (50·√3/2, 50·(-1/2)) ≈ (43.30, -25.00).
