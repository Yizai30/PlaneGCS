OUTPUT:
**NewGraph**:  
Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point (center)  
2. Circle (radius = 50.00)  
3. Point (moving)  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point (moving)  
   - Target: Circle  
2. distance  
   - Start: Point (center)  
   - Target: Point (moving)  
   - Value: 50.00  

**Explanation**:  
The geometric structure consists of a circle with a fixed center point and a radius of 50.00 units. A moving point lies on the circumference of the circle, satisfying the condition that its distance from the center is exactly 50.00 units. The "scale up circle to 1.2x" instruction implies the circle?s radius is scaled to 60.00 units, but since the moving point remains constrained to the circle, its distance from the center updates to 60.00 units accordingly.
