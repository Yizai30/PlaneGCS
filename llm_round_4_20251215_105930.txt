OUTPUT:
Let’s break this down step by step.  

**Current Graph** has:  
- Element1: Point (let’s call it \( A \))  
- Element2: Circle (center unknown, but likely \( A \) is not necessarily the center)  
- Element3: Point (let’s call it \( B \))  

Relations:  
1. `on_circle` — \( B \) is on the circle (Element3 on Element2).  
2. `distance_constraint` — distance between \( A \) (Element1) and \( B \) (Element3) is fixed (likely the radius, but not necessarily if \( A \) is not the center).  

---

**NewContent**: “Rotate to 180 degree position”  

This suggests we are rotating something by 180° around some center.  
Given the elements, the most natural interpretation:  
- We have a circle (Element2) and a point \( B \) on it.  
- Rotating \( B \) by 180° around the **center of the circle** yields another point \( B' \) diametrically opposite.  
- But the center of the circle is not yet an element in the current graph.  

However, the `distance_constraint` between \( A \) and \( B \) suggests \( A \) might be the center of rotation or the circle’s center.  
If \( A \) is the center of the circle, then `distance_constraint` is the radius, and `on_circle` means \( B \) is at distance = radius from \( A \).  

Then “Rotate to 180 degree position” means:  
Take \( B \) and rotate 180° around \( A \) → get \( B' \) such that \( A \) is midpoint of \( BB' \), and \( B' \) is also on the same circle.  

So new elements:  
- New point \( B' \) (Element4)  
- New relation: `on_circle` for \( B' \)  
- New relation: `diametrically_opposite` or `rotation_180` between \( B \) and \( B' \) with center \( A \).  

But since we don’t have a “rotation” relation type in the example, maybe we model it as:  
`midpoint` relation: \( A \) is midpoint of \( B \) and \( B' \), and `distance_constraint` between \( A \) and \( B' \) same as between \( A \) and \( B \).

**NewGraph** after adding:  

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point (Element1) — call it \( A \)  
2. Circle (Element2) — call it \( c \)  
3. Point (Element3) — call it \( B \)  
4. Point (Element4) — call it \( B' \)  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. `on_circle` — \( B \) on \( c \)  
2. `distance_constraint` — \( A \) to \( B \)  
3. `on_circle` — \( B' \) on \( c \)  
4. `distance_constraint` — \( A \) to \( B' \)  
5. `midpoint` — \( A \) is midpoint of \( B \) and \( B' \)  

---

**Final Answer**:

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point  
2. Circle  
3. Point  
4. Point  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle
