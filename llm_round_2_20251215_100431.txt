OUTPUT:
Let’s break this down step by step.  

The **NewContent** says:  
> Continue rotating to 90 degree position  

This implies there is already some geometric object(s) in context that are being rotated, but since **CurGraph** is empty in the given data, we must infer what is being rotated from typical geometry problems.  

Often “rotate to 90 degree position” means rotating a line, segment, or shape until it reaches a 90° orientation relative to some reference. Without prior elements, the simplest assumption is that we start with some **line** or **segment** in an initial position, and we rotate it by some angle until it reaches 90° relative to the horizontal or relative to its starting position.  

But since **CurGraph** is empty, we must introduce the elements needed:  

1. A **line** (or segment) in its initial position.  
2. A **rotation center** (point).  
3. The **rotated line** after rotation to 90° position.  

---

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. **InitialLine** – the line before rotation.  
2. **RotationCenter** – the fixed point about which rotation occurs.  
3. **RotatedLine** – the line after rotation to 90° position.  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. **is_rotated_from**  
   - Start: RotatedLine  
   - Target: InitialLine  
   (This captures that RotatedLine is obtained by rotating InitialLine.)  

2. **rotation_center**  
   - Start: RotationCenter  
   - Target: InitialLine  
   (This indicates RotationCenter is the center of rotation for InitialLine.)  

3. **rotation_angle**  
   - Start: RotatedLine  
   - Target: InitialLine  
   (This relation implies a 90° rotation between them, though in a formal system we might need an “Angle” element; here we can embed the 90° in the relation name or add an Angle element. Let’s keep it simple and embed in relation name.)  

Actually, to be precise, let’s define:  

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. InitialLine  
2. RotationCenter  
3. RotatedLine  
4. Angle90 – represents the rotation angle of 90 degrees.  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. is_rotated_from  
   - Start: RotatedLine  
   - Target: InitialLine  

2. rotation_center  
   - Start: RotationCenter  
   - Target: InitialLine  

3. has_rotation_angle  
   - Start: RotatedLine  
   - Target: Angle90  

4. angle_value  
   - Start: Angle90  
   - Target: 90° (but 90° is a value, not an element; in pure geometry element list, we might not list numerical values as elements. So maybe better to skip Angle90 as element and just have relation “rotated_by_90_degrees” between RotatedLine and InitialLine.)  

Let’s simplify:  

---

**Final Answer:**  

**Geometry Elements List:**  
1. InitialLine  
2. RotationCenter  
3. RotatedLine  

**Geometry Relations List:**  
1. is_rotated_from  
   - Start: RotatedLine  
   - Target: InitialLine  
2. rotation_center  
   - Start: RotationCenter  
   - Target: InitialLine  
3. rotated_by_90_degrees  
   - Start: RotatedLine  
   - Target: InitialLine
