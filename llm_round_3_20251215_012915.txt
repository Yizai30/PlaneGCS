OUTPUT:
**Analysis of the New Content**  
The instruction “scale up circle to 1.2x” means the circle’s radius should be multiplied by 1.2.  
In the current graph, the circle has radius 50.00, and there is a point on the circle at (50, 0) that satisfies the distance constraint from the center (0, 0) equal to 50.00.  

After scaling:  
- The circle’s new radius = \( 50.00 \times 1.2 = 60.00 \).  
- The point that was on the circle at (50, 0) is no longer on the new circle unless it is moved outward to (60, 0) to maintain the “on_circle” relation.  
- The “distance constraint” between the center and that point must also be updated to 60.00 to match the new radius.  

Thus, the updated geometric structure will have:  
- The same center point.  
- The same moving point, but its coordinates change to (60, 0).  
- The circle’s radius updated to 60.00.  
- The relations remain the same in type but with updated parameters.

**Result of the construction of the geometric structure:**

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point(0.00, 0.00) – center  
2. Circle(radius=60.00)  
3. Point(60.00, 0.00) – moving  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. on_circle  
   - Start: Point(60.00, 0.00)  
   - Target: Circle(radius=60.00)  
2. distance_constraint  
   - Start: Point(0.00, 0.00)  
   - Target: Point(60.00, 0.00)  
   (distance = 60.00)
