OUTPUT:
**Analysis of the New Content**  
The new content is: "??????????90??????"  
This appears to be a corrupted or incomplete input, possibly meaning "rotate 90 degrees" or "angle 90 degrees" in another language.  
Given the current geometry graph has:  
- Point (0,0) as center  
- Circle with radius 50  
- Point (50,0) on the circle  

If the intended meaning is "rotate the point by 90 degrees around the center", then a new point would be created at (0,50) after rotation.  
Alternatively, if it means "construct a line segment making 90 degrees with something", more context is needed.  

Since the current graph has a circle and a point on it, a common geometric operation is to construct a **perpendicular radius** or a **tangent line** at that point, which involves a 90-degree angle.  
But the most straightforward interpretation from "90 degrees" here is to **create a new point on the circle rotated 90? from (50,0) around the center**, or to **create a line from the center to the point and another line perpendicular to it**.  

Given the minimal information, I will assume:  
We add a **new point** on the circle such that the angle at the center between the original point and the new point is 90 degrees.
