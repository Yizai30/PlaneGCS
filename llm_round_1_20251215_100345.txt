OUTPUT:
Let’s break this down step by step.  

**Step 1 – Understanding the NewContent**  
The statement is:  
> Move the point clockwise by 30 degrees  

This implies:  
- There is a **point** (though not named yet in CurGraph, but it’s implied in the instruction).  
- There is a **rotation** transformation: “clockwise by 30 degrees” means we need a **center of rotation** (implied or given in context, but here unspecified).  
- “Move” means the point’s new position after rotation is relevant.  

Since CurGraph is empty, we must introduce the elements needed to model this transformation.  

**Step 2 – Identifying geometric elements**  
From the instruction, we can infer:  
1. **Point** (original position) — call it `Point_A`.  
2. **Center of rotation** — call it `Point_O` (must exist for rotation, even if not stated explicitly; in many geometry problems, it’s the origin or a given point).  
3. **Angle** — 30°, clockwise.  
4. **Point** (new position after rotation) — call it `Point_A'`.  
5. **Circle** (with center O, radius OA) — rotation preserves distance OA, so A' lies on this circle.  

**Step 3 – Geometric relations**  
- `Point_A` is rotated around `Point_O` by 30° clockwise to get `Point_A'`.  
- `Point_A'` lies on the circle centered at `Point_O` passing through `Point_A`.  
- The measure of angle ∠AOA' is 30°.  

**Step 4 – Writing in the required format**  

**NewGraph**:  

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point_O  
2. Point_A  
3. Point_A'  
4. Circle_O_A (circle with center O through A)  
5. Angle_AOA'  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. is_center_of  
   - Start: Point_O  
   - Target: Circle_O_A  
2. lies_on_circle  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Circle_O_A  
3. lies_on_circle  
   - Start: Point_A'  
   - Target: Circle_O_A  
4. rotation  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Point_A'  
   - (Note: relation “rotation” implicitly involves center Point_O and angle 30° clockwise; if the format requires explicit angle element, we can add Angle_AOA' as intermediate.)  
5. has_measure  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: 30° (if numeric value is allowed as element; otherwise, treat as property)  

Since the format example shows relations only between named geometry elements, I’ll adjust:  

Actually, in the example, relations like “is_element_of” connect elements. Here, “rotation” is not a standard relation name in basic geometry databases; maybe “image_under_rotation” or “is_rotated_to”. But to keep it simple, I’ll use:  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. is_center_of  
   - Start: Point_O  
   - Target: Circle_O_A  
2. lies_on  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Circle_O_A  
3. lies_on  
   - Start: Point_A'  
   - Target: Circle_O_A  
4. angle_between  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Via: Point_O  
   - Target: Point_A'  
   - (Value: 30°, clockwise)  

But since the format in the example is just “relation name, start, target” without “via”, maybe better to explicitly add the angle as an element and relate it:  

Let’s finalize:  

**NewGraph**:  

Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point_O  
2. Point_A  
3. Point_A'  
4. Circle_O  
5. Angle_AOA'  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. is_center_of  
   - Start: Point_O  
   - Target: Circle_O  
2. lies_on  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Circle_O  
3. lies_on  
   - Start: Point_A'  
   - Target: Circle_O  
4. has_vertex  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: Point_O  
5. has_first_ray_point  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: Point_A  
6. has_second_ray_point  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: Point_A'  
7. has_measure  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: 30° (if allowed as element; if not, omit or treat as property)  

But since “30°” is not listed as a geometry element in the list, maybe “has_measure” is not a relation between two elements in the list. So perhaps omit 7, or include “30°” as an element “Measure_30deg”.  

Given the minimalism in the example, I’ll keep only elements and basic relations:  

**Final answer**:  

**NewGraph**:  
Geometry Elements List:  
1. Point_O  
2. Point_A  
3. Point_A'  
4. Circle_O  
5. Angle_AOA'  

Geometry Relations List:  
1. is_center_of  
   - Start: Point_O  
   - Target: Circle_O  
2. lies_on  
   - Start: Point_A  
   - Target: Circle_O  
3. lies_on  
   - Start: Point_A'  
   - Target: Circle_O  
4. has_vertex  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: Point_O  
5. has_ray  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: Point_A  
6. has_ray  
   - Start: Angle_AOA'  
   - Target: Point_A'
